## User Story
Given a starter code
I want to make changes so it follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

### Refactored base code:
Added:
* title to the website
* html semantic elements (header, nav, img, section, article, footer)
* Alt attributes to images
* comments in boths html and css file

fixed:
* fixed navegation link
